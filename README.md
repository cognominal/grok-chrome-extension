# Attempt at a grok based chrome extension.

## What we have now

So far we add a text input field on the headers of the grok page.
And we sync the grok textarea to that input field.

We want augment the text area prompt by a instruction prepended to the
copied content of the input field. the instruction will be "write each sentence
in russian then in english".

A side panel with place holder content

## Next

search a russian  word in the wikitionnary and display the russian section in the
side panel. 

## Later

Eventually we want to augment the result by making russian words clickable 
search them in the wiktionnary add them to a panel and make spaced repetition learning.
