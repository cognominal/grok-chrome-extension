# Attempt at a grok based chrome extension.

So far we add a text input field on the headers of the grok page.
And we sync the grok textarea to that input field.

Later we want to augment the text area prompt by a instruction prepended to the
copied content of the input field. the instruction will be "write each sentence
in russian then in english".


Eventually we want to augment the result by making russian words clickable 
search them in the wiktionnary add them to a panel and make spaced repetition learning.
